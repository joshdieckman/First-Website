# Code Louisville Project #

This is the project that I completed for the Code Louisville program.  My inspiration was my current unemployment.  I decided to model my project as a resume.  This is the first website that I have ever built that was not for school.  I wrote all of the HTML, CSS, and JQuery on my own.  I did have some inspiration from other websites as well as tutorials.  I did not use any frameworks to complete this other than Flexbox which came in very handy, but can be tricky.  I have to give a huge thank you to Code Louisville, Treehouse and every other resource that I used to be able to get this far.  This is the just the beginning of my journey to become a programmer whether it be the front-end, back-end or in the middle.  Please, check back for more content as I strive to learn and get more experience in programming.
